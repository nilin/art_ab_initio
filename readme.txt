The modules needed for the medium+perception-driven procedure are in ./art/
This procedure is trained in ./train.py 
To apply the trained model use render.py or render_patchwise.py 

The inspiration-driven procedure uses the style transfer from the sub-repository style_transfer.
The resulting imagination image (made for example with imagine.sh) can be used for example in render_patchwise.py
to use method 1 as the baseline technique.
